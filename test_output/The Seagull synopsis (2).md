Can you show me a simple Python function to analyze sentiment?

## Assistant
```python
def analyze_sentiment(text):
    # Simple sentiment analysis
    positive_words = ['good', 'great', 'excellent']
    negative_words = ['bad', 'terrible', 'awful']
    return 'positive' if any(w in text.lower() for w in positive_words) else 'negative'
```

## User
```python
# Testing the function
print(analyze_sentiment('This is great!'))
```
